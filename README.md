# Uniform-Modelling-Thirteen-Streams
Additional files for paper "Uniform Modelling of the Stellar Density of Thirteen Tidal Streams" (Patrick et al. 2021)

Rotation matrices for all the streams (Table A1 in the paper) are included in rotation_matrices.fits in the Rotation Matrices folder.

Node Phi 1 positions, mean node values, and 16th/84th percentile node values for the cubic splines (Table B1 in the paper) are included in the Cubic Splines folder.  There is one FITS file for each type of spline, which contains the nodes for all the streams.

The stream track of each stream in both stream aligned coordinates (Phi 1/Phi 2) and RA/Dec (Table B2 in the paper) are included in the Stream Tracks folder.  There is one FITS file for each stream that contains 100 sampled points evenly spaced in Phi 1.
